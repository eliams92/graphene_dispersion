TITLE: HALDANE MODEL IN GRAPHENE

DESCRIPTION: When a complex values next nearest neighbour hopping is introduced into graphene, the time-reversal symmetry breaks and graphene can host chiral edge states. These chiral edge states can be observed when an infinite graphene is opened along one direction. The code is written with the help of open-source Kwant package in Python. The parameter values (t_2 and t_2i) to obtain chiral edge states in graphene are used from the paper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.2015
